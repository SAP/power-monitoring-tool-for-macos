# Power Monitor 
 
Power Monitor is a powerful open-source tool that provides real-time insights into your device's energy consumption and carbon footprint, linked to your location. Here's how it can help you:

🔌 Measure Energy Consumption: Track how much energy your Mac consumes, helping you understand the environmental impact of your device usage.

🌍 Location-Based Carbon Footprint: See the carbon footprint generated by your device, taking into account your location. Make informed choices for a greener future.

📈 Data-Driven Decisions: With data measured every 5 seconds and storage of maximum values from the last 24 hours, pinpoint energy hogs and optimize your usage for efficiency.

🌟 Technical Accuracy: While it's not possible to measure exact wattage directly on the Mac, Power Monitor provides a reliable estimate based on external power meter tests.

**Make a positive impact, reduce energy waste, and contribute to sustainability with Power Monitor!**
