# SAP Repository Template

Default templates for SAP open source repositories, including LICENSE, .reuse/dep5, Code of Conduct, etc... All repositories on github.com/SAP will be created based on this template.

## To-Do

In case you are the maintainer of a new SAP open source project, these are the steps to do with the template files:

- Check if the default license (Apache 2.0) also applies to your project. A license change should only be required in exceptional cases. If this is the case, please change the [license file](LICENSE).
- Enter the correct metadata for the REUSE tool. See our [wiki page](https://wiki.one.int.sap/wiki/display/ospodocs/Using+the+Reuse+Tool+of+FSFE+for+Copyright+and+License+Information) for details how to do it. You can find an initial .reuse/dep5 file to build on. Please replace the parts inside the single angle quotation marks < > by the specific information for your repository and be sure to run the REUSE tool to validate that the metadata is correct.
- Adjust the contribution guidelines (e.g. add coding style guidelines, pull request checklists, different license if needed etc.)
- Add information about your project to this README (name, description, requirements etc). Especially take care for the <your-project> placeholders - those ones need to be replaced with your project name. See the sections below the horizontal line and [our guidelines on our wiki page](https://wiki.one.int.sap/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3564976048#GuidelinesforGitHubHealthfiles(Readme,Contributing,CodeofConduct)-Readme.md) what is required and recommended.
- Remove all content in this README above and including the horizontal line ;)
